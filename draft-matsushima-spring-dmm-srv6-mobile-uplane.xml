      <t>This document discusses the applicability of SRv6 (Segment Routing
      IPv6) to user-plane of mobile networks that SRv6 source routing
      capability with its programmability can fulfill the user-plane
      functions, such as access and anchor functions. It takes advantage of
      underlying layer awareness and flexibility to deploy user-plane
      functions that enables optimizing data-path for applications. Network
      slicing and an interworking way between SRv6 and existing mobile

    <section title="Introduction">

        <t>In mobile networks, mobility management systems provide
        connectivity while mobile nodes move around. While the
        control-plane of the system signals movements of a mobile node,
        user-plane establishes tunnel between the mobile node and anchor
        node over IP based backhaul and core networks. </t>

        <t>This document discusses the applicability of SRv6 (Segment
        Routing IPv6) to those mobile networks. SRv6 provides source
        routing to networks where operators can explicitly indicate route
        for the packets from and to the mobile node. SRv6 endpoint nodes
        act as roles of anchor of mobile user-plane. </t>

        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

    <section anchor="motivations" title="Motivations">
    
        <t>Today's and future applications are requiring highly optimized
        data-path between mobile nodes and the entities of those
        applications in perspectives of latency, bandwidth, etc,. However
        current architecture of mobile management is agnostic about
        underlying topologies of transport layer. It rigidly fragments the
        user-plane in radio access, core and service networks and connects
        them by tunneling techniques through the user-plane functions such
        as access and anchor nodes. Those agnostic and rigidness make it
        difficult for the operator to optimize the data-path.</t>
    
        <t>While the mobile network industry has been trying to solve that,
        applications shift to use IPv6 data-path and network operators
        adopt it as their IP transport as well. SRv6 integrates both
        application data-path and underlying transport layer in data-path
        optimization aspects that does not require any other techniques.</t>
        
        <t>SRv6 source routing capability with programmable functions <xref
        target="I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming"/> could
        fulfills the user-plane functions of mobility management.  It takes
        advantage of underlying layer awareness and flexibility to deploy
        user-plane functions. Those are the motivations to adopt SRv6 for
        mobile user-plane.</t>

    <section anchor="uplane" title="Mobile User-Plane">
        <t>This section describes user-plane using SRv6 for mobile
        networks. This clarifies mobile user-plane functions to which SRv6
        endpoint applied.</t>
        
        <t><xref target="fig_srv6-uplane"/> shows mobile user-plane
        functions which are connected through SRv6 enabled IPv6 networks.
        In the <xref target="fig_srv6-uplane"/>, an mobile node (MN)
        connects to an SRv6 endpoint serving access node role for the MN.
        When the endpoint receives packets from the MN, it pushes SRH to
        the packets. The segment list in the SRH indicates the rest of
        user-plane segments which are L2 and L3 anchors respectively. Then
        the endpoint send the packets to the SRv6 enabled IPv6 network. In
        opposite direction, when an SRv6 endpoint serving L3 anchor role
        for the MN receives packets to it, the endpoint push SRH consist of
        the L2 anchor and access node segments to the packets.</t>

        <t>An SRv6 segment represents those each function, such as Access
        Node, Layer-2 (L2) Anchor and Layer-3 (L3) Anchor. This makes
        mobile networks highly flexible to deploy any user-plane functions
        to which nodes in user flow basis. An SRv6 segment can represent a
        set of flows in any granularity of aggregation even though it is
        just for a single flow.</t>
        
        <t><xref target="fig_interwork"/> shows that an SRv6 endpoint connects
        existing IPv4 mobile user-plane, which is defined in <xref
        target="RFC5213"/> and <xref target="TS.29281"/>. An SRv6 segment
        in the endpoint represents interworking function which enables
        interworking between existing access node and SRv6 anchor segment,
        or SRv6 access node segment and existing anchor node.</t>
        
        <t>Existing mobile user-plane with IPv6 underlay is expected to be
        widely deployed. As IPv6 network should be interoperable with SRv6
        enabled network and SRv6 endpoints can be accommodated on it,
        interworking with existing IPv6 network is out of scope of this
        document.</t>

    <section anchor="uplane-functions" title="User-Plane Functions">
    
        <t>This section describes mobile user-plane functions applied to
        SRv6 segment. SRv6 endpoint is capable to do that. Terminology of
        endpoint functions refers to the net-pgm draft. SRv6 endpoint
        functions are considered for each direction, such as uplink (UL)
        from mobile node to the correspondent node, and downlink (DL) from
        the correspondent node to mobile node.</t>

                <t>Access node segment provides SRv6 endpoint the role to
                which mobile node is connected directly. eNodeB could be
                referenced as an entity implementing the access node in
                3GPP term. The applicable SRv6 functions for the access
                nodes are following:</t>

                T.Insert process for the receiving packets from mobile node
                when the packets matched to the policy bound to the segment
                in case IPv6 is the outer header of the packet. When the
                header is IPv4, or other types, the endpoint does T.Encap
                process for the packets. The segment list represents policy

                <t>In downlink, the endpoint does End.X process for
                receiving packets when the active segment represents access
                node to the mobile node. When the segment left of receiving
                packets is zero, and IPv4 is indicated as the effective
                next header (ENH), the endpoint does End.DX4 process for
                the packets. When the ENH indicates layer-2 type, the

                Serving Gateway (SGW) could be referenced as an entity
                implementing the layer-2 anchor in 3GPP term. The

                endpoint of interworking segment could be unaware from the
                control-plane of the mobility management. While there are
                combinations of interworking either existing or SRv6
                network in which user-plane functions accommodate,
                interworking segment should cover all combinations without
                mobility state.</t>
                
                <t>To fulfill the above requirements, SID for interworking
                segment is encoding identifiers of corresponding tunnel in
                existing network as argument of the SID. Tunnel encoding
                format in SID is following:</t>

                <t>In SRv6 to existing network direction, an endpoint of an
                interworking segment allocate a node local SID prefix to
                interworking segments. When the endpoint receives packet
                and the active segment of the packet indicates the SID, the
                endpoint pop the SRH of the SID, and then the endpoint
                encaps the payload with the encoded information in the SID
                which are tunnel identifier of tunnel header, source and
                destination IPv4 address of IPv4 header described in
                <xref target="fig_interwork-sid"/>. Then the endpoint send
                out the packet to the existing network along with its
                routing policy.</t>
                
                <t>In existing network to SRv6 network direction, existing
                network allocates IPv4 address spaces routed to
                interworking SRv6 network. SRv6 network allocates a
                domain-wise SID prefix for interworking segments. When a
                SRv6 endpoint connects to existing network receives packet
                destined to the allocated IPv4 address, the endpoint decaps
                outer IPv4 and tunnel header. And then the endpoint does
                T.Insert process with the SID which consists of the
                allocated domain-wise SID prefix, source and destination
                addresses, and tunnel identifier as described in
                <xref target="fig_interwork-sid"/>. Then the endpoint send
                out the packet to the SRv6 network along with its routing
                policy.</t>
                
                <t>In case of IPv4 flow packet over the user-plane, the
                endpoint does IPv6 header encaps and decaps instead of SRH
                insert and pop process. The IPv6 header includes
                interworking segment SID in the SRH.</t>
                
                <t>Noted that to make sure stateless interworking, entities
                of control-plane in mobile management should cooperate with
                SRv6 user-plane settings. Further control-plane
                consideration is discussed in <xref target="c-plane"/>.</t>

                <t>Mobile user-plane requires rate-limit feature. SID is
                able to encode limiting rate as an argument in SID.
                Multiple flows of packets should have same group identifier
                in SID when those flows are in an same AMBR group. This
                helps to keep user-plane stateless. That enables SRv6
                endpoint nodes which are unaware from the mobile
                control-plane information. Encoding format of rate limit
                segment SID is following:</t>

    <section anchor="netslice" title="Network Slicing Considerations">
    
        <t>Mobile network may be required to create a network slicing that
        represent a set of network resources and isolate those resource
        from other slices. User-plane functions represented as SRv6
        segments would be part of a slice.</t>
        
        <t>To represent a set of user-plane function segments for a slice,
        sharing same prefix through those SIDs within the slice could be a
        straightforward way. SIDs in a network slice may include other type
        of functions in addition to the mobile user-plane functions
        described in this document, and underlay integration to meet SLA and
        quality requirements.</t>
        
        <t>While network slicing has been discussed in the IETF and other
        standardization bodies, what functionalities are required for
        network slicing in mobile user-plane is further study item and to
        be discussed.</t>

    <section anchor="c-plane" title="Control Plane Considerations">
    
        <t>Mobile control-plane entities must allocate SIDs to user-plane
        function segments in case of those entities are distributed to
        accommodate in the SRv6 endpoints, or those are separated from the
        endpoint but each of them corresponds to each SRv6 endpoint. In
        latter case,  control-plane entity must advertise allocated SID to
        the endpoint through some means.</t>
        
        <t>When a centralized controller interfaces to mobile
        control-planes is capable to allocate SIDs to the controlling SRv6
        endpoints, the mobile control-planes just need to indicate the
        endpoint nodes and their user-plane roles to the controller. In
        this case, the controller must allocate appropriate SIDs for the
        user-plane roles to the indicated SRv6 endpoints. The controller
        must advertise allocated SIDs to the endpoints.</t>
        
        <t>To indicate endpoints and their user-plane functions from mobile
        control-plane to user-plane, the endpoint or the controller could
        take advantage of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp"/>. It
        provides interface to the control-plane to manage the user-plane of
        mobile networks.</t>
        
        <t>In case of stateless interworking, SID allocating entity needs
        to be aware SID prefix which interworking SRv6 endpoint and SRv6
        domain allocate discussed in <xref target="interwork"/>. The mobile
        control-plane also need to allocate tunnel endpoint IPv4 address to
        which corresponding interworking segment destined from existing
        user-plane that is also discussed in <xref target="interwork"/>.</t>
