               Segment Routing IPv6 for Mobile User Plane
                  draft-ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane-09

Abstract

   This document shows the applicability of SRv6 (Segment Routing IPv6)
   to the user-plane of mobile networks.  The network programming nature
   of SRv6 accomplish mobile user-plane functions in a simple manner.
   The statelessness of SRv6 and its ability to control both service
   layer path and underlying transport can be beneficial to the mobile
   user-plane, providing flexibility, end-to-end network slicing and SLA
   control for various applications.  This document describes the SRv6
   mobile user plane.

1.  Introduction

   In mobile networks, mobility management systems provide connectivity
   while mobile nodes move.  While the control-plane of the system
   signals movements of a mobile node, the user-plane establishes a
   tunnel between the mobile node and its anchor node over IP-based
   backhaul and core networks.

   This document shows the applicability of SRv6 (Segment Routing IPv6)
   to those mobile networks.  SRv6 provides source routing to networks
   so that operators can explicitly indicate a route for the packets to
   and from the mobile node.  SRv6 endpoint nodes serve as the anchors
   of mobile user-plane.

   o  UPF: User Plane Function
   o  VNF: Virtual Network Function

2.2.  Conventions

   o  NH=SRH means that NH is 43 with routing type 4.
   o  Multiple SRHs may be present inside each packet, but they must
      follow each other.  The next-header field of each SRH, except the
      last one, must be NH-SRH (43 type 4).
   o  For simplicity, no other extension headers are shown except the
      SRH.
   o  The SID type used in this document is SRv6 SID.
   o  gNB::1 is an IPv6 address (SID) assigned to the gNB.
   o  U1::1 is an IPv6 address (SID) assigned to UPF1.
   o  U2::1 is an IPv6 address (SID) assigned to UPF2.
   o  U2:: is some other IPv6 address (SID) assigned to UPF2.
   o  A SID list is represented as <S1, S2, S3> where S1 is the first
      SID to visit, S2 is the second SID to visit and S3 is the last SID
      to visit along the SR path.
   o  (SA,DA) (S3, S2, S1; SL) represents an IPv6 packet with:

      *  IPv6 header with source and destination addresses SA and DA
         respectively, and next-header SRH, with SID list <S1, S2, S3>
         with SegmentsLeft = SL
      *  The payload of the packet is not represented.
   o  Note the difference between the <> and () symbols: <S1, S2, S3>
      represents a SID list where S1 is the first SID and S3 is the last
      SID.  (S3, S2, S1; SL) represents the same SID list but encoded in
      the SRH format where the rightmost SID in the SRH is the first SID
      and the leftmost SID in the SRH is the last SID.  When referring
      to an SR policy in a high-level use-case, it is simpler to use the
      <S1, S2, S3> notation.  When referring to an illustration of the
      detailed behavior, the (S3, S2, S1; SL) notation is more
      convenient.
   o  SRH[SL] represents the SID pointed by the SL field in the first
      SRH.  In our example, SRH[2] represents S1, SRH[1] represents S2
      and SRH[0] represents S3.
   o  SRH[SL] can be different from the DA of the IPv6 header.

2.3.  Predefined SRv6 Functions

   The following functions are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].

   o  End.DT4 means to decapsulate and forward using a specific IPv4
      table lookup.
   o  End.DT6 means to decapsulate and forward using a specific IPv6
      table lookup.

Internet-Draft             SRv6-mobile-uplane                  June 2020


   o  End.DX4 means to decapsulate the packet and forward through a
      particular outgoing interface -or set of OIFs- configured with the
      SID.
   o  End.DX6 means to decapsulate and forward through a particular
      outgoing interface -or set of OIFs- configured with the SID.
   o  End.DX2 means to decapsulate the L2 frame and forward through a
      particular outgoing interface -or set of OIFs- configured with the
      SID.
   o  End.T means to forward using a specific IPv6 table lookup.
   o  End.X means to forward through a link configured with the SID.
   o  T.Encaps.Red means encapsulation without pushing SRH (resulting in
      "Reduced" packet size).
   o  PSP means Penultimate Segment Pop.  The packet is subsequently
      forwarded without the popped SRH.

   New SRv6 functions are defined in Section 6 to support the needs of
   the mobile user plane.

3.  Motivation

   Mobility networks are becoming more challenging to operate.  On one
   hand, traffic is constantly growing, and latency requirements are
   more strict; on the other-hand, there are new use-cases like NFV that
   are also challenging network management.

   The current architecture of mobile networks does not take into
   account the underlying transport.  The user-plane is rigidly
   fragmented into radio access, core and service networks, connected by
   tunneling according to user-plane roles such as access and anchor
   nodes.  These factors have made it difficult for the operator to
   optimize and operate the data-path.

   In the meantime, applications have shifted to use IPv6, and network
   operators have started adopting IPv6 as their IP transport.  SRv6,
   the IPv6 dataplane instantiation of Segment Routing [RFC8402],
   integrates both the application data-path and the underlying
   transport layer into a single protocol, allowing operators to
   optimize the network in a simplified manner and removing forwarding
   state from the network.  It is also suitable for virtualized
   environments, VNF/CNF to VNF/CNF networking.

   SRv6 specifies network-programming (see
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming]).  Applied to mobility,
   SRv6 can provide the user-plane functions needed for mobility
   management.  SRv6 takes advantage of underlying transport awareness
   and flexibility to improve mobility user-plane functions.

   The use-cases for SRv6 mobility are discussed in
   [I-D.camarilloelmalky-springdmm-srv6-mob-usecases].

4.  A 3GPP Reference Architecture

   This section presents a reference architecture and possible
   deployment scenarios.

   Figure 1 shows a reference diagram from the 5G packet core
   architecture [TS.23501].

   The user plane described in this document does not depend on any
   specific architecture.  The 5G packet core architecture as shown is
   based on the latest 3GPP standards at the time of writing this draft.
   Other architectures can be seen in [I-D.gundavelli-dmm-mfa] and
   [WHITEPAPER-5G-UP].

   This reference diagram does not depict a UPF that is only connected
   to N9 interfaces, although the description in this document also work
   for such UPFs.

   Each session from an UE gets assigned to a UPF.  Sometimes multiple
   UPFs may be used, providing richer service functions.  A UE gets its
   IP address from the DHCP block of its UPF.  The UPF advertises that

   IP address block toward the Internet, ensuring that return traffic is
   routed to the right UPF.

5.  User-plane behaviors

   This section describes some mobile user-plane behaviors using SRv6.

   In order to simplify the adoption of SRv6, we present two different
   "modes" that vary with respect to the use of SRv6.  The first one is
   the "Traditional mode", which inherits the current 3GPP mobile user-
   plane.  In this mode there is no change to mobility networks
   architecture, except that GTP-U [TS.29281] is replaced by SRv6.

   The second mode is the "Enhanced mode".  In this mode the SR policy
   contains SIDs for Traffic Engineering and VNFs, which results in
   effective end-to-end network slices.

   In both, the Traditional and the Enhanced modes, we assume that the
   gNB as well as the UPFs are SR-aware (N3, N9 and -potentially- N6
   interfaces are SRv6).

   We introduce two mechanisms for interworking with legacy access
   networks (N3 interface is unmodified).  In this document we introduce
   them applied to the Enhanced mode, although they could be used in
   combination with the Traditional mode as well.

   One of these mechanisms is designed to interwork with legacy gNBs
   using GTP/IPv4.  The second method is designed to interwork with
   legacy gNBs using GTP/IPv6.

   This document uses SRv6 functions defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] as well as new SRv6
   functions designed for the mobile user plane.  The new SRv6 functions
   are detailed in Section 6.

5.1.  Traditional mode

   In the traditional mode, the existing mobile UPFs remain unchanged
   except for the use of SRv6 as the data plane instead of GTP-U.  There
   is no impact to the rest of mobile system.

   In existing 3GPP mobile networks, an UE PDU Session is mapped 1-for-1
   with a specific GTP tunnel (TEID).  This 1-for-1 mapping is mirrored
   here to replace GTP encapsulation with the SRv6 encapsulation, while
   not changing anything else.  There will be a unique SRv6 SID
   associated with each UE PDU Session.

   The traditional mode minimizes the changes required to the mobile
   system; it is a good starting point for forming a common basis.

   Our example topology is shown in Figure 2.  In traditional mode the
   gNB and the UPFs are SR-aware.  In the descriptions of the uplink and
   downlink packet flow, A is an IPv6 address of the UE, and Z is an
   IPv6 address reachable within the Data Network DN.  A new SRv6
   function End.MAP, defined in Section 6.2, is used.

5.1.1.  Packet flow - Uplink

   The uplink packet flow is as follows:

         UE_out  : (A,Z)
         gNB_out : (gNB, U1::1) (A,Z)     -> T.Encaps.Red <U1::1>
         UPF1_out: (gNB, U2::1) (A,Z)     -> End.MAP
         UPF2_out: (A,Z)                  -> End.DT4 or End.DT6

   When the UE packet arrives at the gNB, the gNB performs a
   T.Encaps.Red operation.  Since there is only one SID, there is no
   need to push an SRH. gNB only adds an outer IPv6 header with IPv6 DA
   U1::1.  U1::1 represents an anchoring SID specific for that session
   at UPF1. gNB obtains the SID U1::1 from the existing control plane
   (N2 interface).

   When the packet arrives at UPF1, the SID U1::1 identifies a local
   End.MAP function.  End.MAP replaces U1::1 by U2::1, that belongs to
   the next UPF (U2).

   When the packet arrives at UPF2, the SID U2::1 corresponds to an
   End.DT function.  UPF2 decapsulates the packet, performs a lookup in
   a specific table associated with that mobile network and forwards the
   packet toward the data network (DN).

5.1.2.  Packet flow - Downlink

   The downlink packet flow is as follows:

         UPF2_out: (U2::, U1::1) (Z,A)    -> T.Encaps.Red <U1::1>
         UPF1_out: (U2::, gNB::1) (Z,A)   -> End.MAP
         gNB_out : (Z,A)                  -> End.DX4 or End.DX6

   When the packet arrives at the UPF2, the UPF2 maps that flow into a
   UE PDU Session.  This UE PDU Session is associated with the segment
   endpoint <U1::1>.  UPF2 performs a T.Encaps.Red operation,
   encapsulating the packet into a new IPv6 header with no SRH since
   there is only one SID.

   Upon packet arrival on UPF1, the SID U1::1 is a local End.MAP
   function.  This function maps the SID to the next anchoring point and
   replaces U1::1 by gNB::1, that belongs to the next hop.

   Upon packet arrival on gNB, the SID gNB::1 corresponds to an End.DX4
   or End.DX6 function.  The gNB decapsulates the packet, removing the
   IPv6 header and all its extensions headers, and forwards the traffic
   toward the UE.

5.2.  Enhanced Mode

   Enhanced mode improves scalability, traffic steering and service
   programming [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-service-programming], thanks to the
   use of multiple SIDs, instead of a single SID as done in the
   Traditional mode.

   The main difference is that the SR policy MAY include SIDs for
   traffic engineering and service programming in addition to the UPFs
   SIDs.

   The gNB control-plane (N2 interface) is unchanged, specifically a
   single IPv6 address is given to the gNB.

   o  The gNB MAY resolve the IP address into a SID list using a
      mechanism like PCEP, DNS-lookup, small augment for LISP control-
      plane, etc.

   Note that the SIDs MAY use the arguments Args.Mob.Session if required
   by the UPFs.

   Figure 3 shows an Enhanced mode topology.  In the Enhanced mode, the
   gNB and the UPF are SR-aware.  The Figure shows two service segments,
   S1 and C1.  S1 represents a VNF in the network, and C1 represents a
   constraint path on a router requiring Traffic Engineering.  S1 and C1
   belong to the underlay and don't have an N4 interface, so they are
   not considered UPFs.

5.2.1.  Packet flow - Uplink

   The uplink packet flow is as follows:

   UE_out  : (A,Z)
   gNB_out : (gNB, S1)(U2::1, C1; SL=2)(A,Z)-> T.Encaps.Red<S1,C1,U2::1>
   S1_out  : (gNB, C1)(U2::1, C1; SL=1 (A,Z)
   C1_out  : (gNB, U2::1)(A,Z)              -> PSP
   UPF2_out: (A,Z)                          -> End.DT4 or End.DT6

   UE sends its packet (A,Z) on a specific bearer to its gNB.  gNB's
   control plane associates that session from the UE(A) with the IPv6
   address B and GTP TEID T.  gNB's control plane does a lookup on B to
   find the related SID list <S1, C1, U2::1>.

   When gNB transmits the packet, it contains all the segments of the SR
   policy.  The SR policy can include segments for traffic engineering
   (C1) and for service programming (S1).

   Nodes S1 and C1 perform their related Endpoint functionality and
   forward the packet.

   When the packet arrives at UPF2, the active segment (U2::1) is an
   End.DT4/6 which performs the decapsulation (removing the IPv6 header
   with all its extension headers) and forwards toward the data network.

5.2.2.  Packet flow - Downlink

   The downlink packet flow is as follows:

   UPF2_in : (Z,A)                              -> UPF2 maps the flow w/
                                                   SID list <C1,S1, gNB>
   UPF2_out: (U2::1, C1)(gNB, S1; SL=2)(Z,A)    -> T.Encaps.Red
   C1_out  : (U2::1, S1)(gNB, S1; SL=1)(Z,A)
   S1_out  : (U2::1, gNB)(Z,A)                  -> PSP
   gNB_out : (Z,A)                              -> End.DX4 or End.DX6

   When the packet arrives at the UPF2, the UPF2 maps that particular
   flow into a UE PDU Session.  This UE PDU Session is associated with
   the policy <C1, S1, gNB>.  The UPF2 performs a T.Encaps.Red
   operation, encapsulating the packet into a new IPv6 header with its
   corresponding SRH.

   The nodes C1 and S1 perform their related Endpoint processing.

   Once the packet arrives at the gNB, the IPv6 DA corresponds to an
   End.DX4 or End.DX6 (depending on the underlying traffic).  The gNB
   decapsulates the packet, removing the IPv6 header and all its
   extensions headers and forwards the traffic toward the UE.

5.3.  Enhanced mode with unchanged gNB GTP behavior

   This section describes two mechanisms for interworking with legacy
   gNBs that still use GTP: one for IPv4, the other for IPv6.

   In the interworking scenarios as illustrated in Figure 4, gNB does
   not support SRv6.  gNB supports GTP encapsulation over IPv4 or IPv6.
   To achieve interworking, a SR Gateway (SRGW-UPF1) entity is added.
   The SRGW maps the GTP traffic into SRv6.

   The SRGW is not an anchor point and maintains very little state.  For
   this reason, both IPv4 and IPv6 methods scale to millions of UEs.

                                                              _______

5.3.1.  Interworking with IPv6 GTP

   In this interworking mode the gNB uses GTP over IPv6 via the N3
   interface

   Key points:

   o  The gNB is unchanged (control-plane or user-plane) and
      encapsulates into GTP (N3 interface is not modified).
   o  The 5G Control-Plane (N2 interface) is unmodified; one IPv6
      address is needed (i.e. a BSID at the SRGW).
   o  The SRGW removes GTP, finds the SID list related to DA, and adds
      SRH with the SID list.
   o  There is no state for the downlink at the SRGW.
   o  There is simple state in the uplink at the SRGW; using Enhanced
      mode results in fewer SR policies on this node.  A SR policy can
      be shared across UEs.
   o  When a packet from the UE leaves the gNB, it is SR-routed.  This
      simplifies network slicing [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo].
   o  In the uplink, the IPv6 DA BSID steers traffic into an SR policy
      when it arrives at the SRGW-UPF1.

   An example topology is shown in Figure 5.  In this mode the gNB is an
   unmodified gNB using IPv6/GTP.  The UPFs are SR-aware.  As before,
   the SRGW maps IPv6/GTP traffic to SRv6.

   S1 and C1 are two service segments.  S1 represents a VNF in the
   network, and C1 represents a router configured for Traffic
   Engineering.

5.3.1.1.  Packet flow - Uplink

   The uplink packet flow is as follows:

   UE_out  : (A,Z)
   gNB_out : (gNB, B)(GTP: TEID T)(A,Z)       -> Interface N3 unmodified
                                                 (IPv6/GTP)

   The UE sends a packet destined to Z toward the gNB on a specific
   bearer for that session.  The gNB, which is unmodified, encapsulates
   the packet into IPv6, UDP and GTP headers.  The IPv6 DA B, and the
   GTP TEID T are the ones received in the N2 interface.

   The IPv6 address that was signaled over the N2 interface for that UE
   PDU Session, B, is now the IPv6 DA.  B is an SRv6 Binding SID at the
   SRGW.  Hence the packet is routed to the SRGW.

   When the packet arrives at the SRGW, the SRGW identifies B as an
   End.M.GTP6.D Binding SID (see Section 6.3).  Hence, the SRGW removes
   the IPv6, UDP and GTP headers, and pushes an IPv6 header with its own
   SRH containing the SIDs bound to the SR policy associated with this
   BindingSID.  There is one instance of the End.M.GTP6.D SID per PDU
   type.

   S1 and C1 perform their related Endpoint functionality and forward
   the packet.

   When the packet arrives at UPF2, the active segment is (U2::1) which
   is bound to End.DT4/6.  UPF2 then decapsulates (removing the outer
   IPv6 header with all its extension headers) and forwards the packet
   toward the data network.

5.3.1.2.  Packet flow - Downlink

   The downlink packet flow is as follows:

   UPF2_in : (Z,A)                           -> UPF2 maps the flow with
                                                <C1, S1, SRGW::TEID,gNB>
   UPF2_out: (U2::1, C1)(gNB, SRGW::TEID, S1; SL=3)(Z,A) -> T.Encaps.Red
   C1_out  : (U2::1, S1)(gNB, SRGW::TEID, S1; SL=2)(Z,A)
   S1_out  : (U2::1, SRGW::TEID)(gNB, SRGW::TEID, S1, SL=1)(Z,A)
   SRGW_out: (SRGW, gNB)(GTP: TEID=T)(Z,A)   -> SRGW/96 is End.M.GTP6.E
   gNB_out : (Z,A)

   When a packet destined to A arrives at the UPF2, the UPF2 performs a
   lookup in the table associated to A and finds the SID list <C1, S1,
   SRGW::TEID, gNB>.  The UPF2 performs a T.Encaps.Red operation,
   encapsulating the packet into a new IPv6 header with its
   corresponding SRH.

   C1 and S1 perform their related Endpoint processing.

   Once the packet arrives at the SRGW, the SRGW identifies the active
   SID as an End.M.GTP6.E function.  The SRGW removes the IPv6 header
   and all its extensions headers.  The SRGW generates new IPv6, UDP and
   GTP headers.  The new IPv6 DA is the gNB which is the last SID in the

   received SRH.  The TEID in the generated GTP header is an argument of
   the received End.M.GTP6.E SID.  The SRGW pushes the headers to the
   packet and forwards the packet toward the gNB.  There is one instance
   of the End.M.GTP6.E SID per PDU type.

   Once the packet arrives at the gNB, the packet is a regular IPv6/GTP
   packet.  The gNB looks for the specific radio bearer for that TEID
   and forward it on the bearer.  This gNB behavior is not modified from
   current and previous generations.

5.3.1.3.  Scalability

   For the downlink traffic, the SRGW is stateless.  All the state is in
   the SRH inserted by the UPF2.  The UPF2 must have the UE states since
   it is the UE's session anchor point.

   For the uplink traffic, the state at the SRGW does not necessarily
   need to be unique per UE PDU Session; the state state can be shared
   among UEs.  This enables much more scalable SRGW deployments compared
   to a solution holding millions of states, one or more per UE.

5.3.2.  Interworking with IPv4 GTP

   In this interworking mode the gNB uses GTP over IPv4 in the N3
   interface

   Key points:

   o  The gNB is unchanged and encapsulates packets into GTP (the N3
      interface is not modified).
   o  In the uplink, traffic is classified by SRGW's Uplink Classifier
      and steered into an SR policy.  The SRGW is a UPF1 functionality
      and can coexist with UPF1's Uplink Classifier functionality.
   o  SRGW removes GTP, finds the SID list related to DA, and adds a SRH
      with the SID list.

   An example topology is shown in Figure 6.  In this mode the gNB is an
   unmodified gNB using IPv4/GTP.  The UPFs are SR-aware.  As before,
   the SRGW maps the IPv4/GTP traffic to SRv6.

   S1 and C1 are two service segment endpoints.  S1 represents a VNF in
   the network, and C1 represents a router configured for Traffic
   Engineering.

5.3.2.1.  Packet flow - Uplink

   The uplink packet flow is as follows:

   gNB_out : (gNB, B)(GTP: TEID T)(A,Z)          -> Interface N3
                                                    unchanged IPv4/GTP
   SRGW_out: (SRGW, S1)(U2::1, C1; SL=2)(A,Z)    -> T.M.GTP4.D function
   S1_out  : (SRGW, C1)(U2::1, C1; SL=1)(A,Z)
   C1_out  : (SRGW, U2::1) (A,Z)                 -> PSP
   UPF2_out: (A,Z)                               -> End.DT4 or End.DT6

   The UE sends a packet destined to Z toward the gNB on a specific
   bearer for that session.  The gNB, which is unmodified, encapsulates
   the packet into a new IPv4, UDP and GTP headers.  The IPv4 DA, B, and
   the GTP TEID are the ones received at the N2 interface.

   When the packet arrives at the SRGW for UPF1, the SRGW has an Uplink
   Classifier rule for incoming traffic from the gNB, that steers the
   traffic into an SR policy by using the function T.M.GTP4.D.  The SRGW
   removes the IPv4, UDP and GTP headers and pushes an IPv6 header with
   its own SRH containing the SIDs related to the SR policy associated
   with this traffic.  The SRGW forwards according to the new IPv6 DA.

   S1 and C1 perform their related Endpoint functionality and forward
   the packet.

   When the packet arrives at UPF2, the active segment is (U2::1) which
   is bound to End.DT4/6 which performs the decapsulation (removing the
   outer IPv6 header with all its extension headers) and forwards toward
   the data network.

5.3.2.2.  Packet flow - Downlink

   The downlink packet flow is as follows:

Internet-Draft             SRv6-mobile-uplane                  June 2020


   UPF2_in : (Z,A)                            -> UPF2 maps flow with SID
                                               <C1, S1,SRGW::SA:DA:TEID>
   UPF2_out: (U2::1, C1)(SRGW::SA:DA:TEID, S1; SL=2)(Z,A) ->T.Encaps.Red
   C1_out  : (U2::1, S1)(SRGW::SA:DA:TEID, S1; SL=1)(Z,A)
   S1_out  : (U2::1, SRGW::SA:DA:TEID)(Z,A)
   SRGW_out: (SA, DA)(GTP: TEID=T)(Z,A)       -> End.M.GTP4.E
   gNB_out : (Z,A)

   When a packet destined to A arrives at the UPF2, the UPF2 performs a
   lookup in the table associated to A and finds the SID list <C1, S1,
   SRGW::SA:DA:TEID>.  The UPF2 performs a T.Encaps.Red operation,
   encapsulating the packet into a new IPv6 header with its
   corresponding SRH.

   The nodes C1 and S1 perform their related Endpoint processing.

   Once the packet arrives at the SRGW, the SRGW identifies the active
   SID as an End.M.GTP4.E function.  The SRGW removes the IPv6 header
   and all its extensions headers.  The SRGW generates an IPv4, UDP and
   GTP headers.  The IPv4 SA and DA are received as SID arguments.  The
   TEID in the generated GTP header is also the arguments of the
   received End.M.GTP4.E SID.  The SRGW pushes the headers to the packet
   and forwards the packet toward the gNB.

   When the packet arrives at the gNB, the packet is a regular IPv4/GTP
   packet.  The gNB looks for the specific radio bearer for that TEID
   and forward it on the bearer.  This gNB behavior is not modified from
   current and previous generations.

5.3.2.3.  Scalability

   For the downlink traffic, the SRGW is stateless.  All the state is in
   the SRH inserted by the UPF.  The UPF must have this UE-base state
   anyway (since it is its anchor point).

   For the uplink traffic, the state at the SRGW is dedicated on a per
   UE/session basis according to an Uplink Classifier.  There is state
   for steering the different sessions in the form of a SR Policy.
   However, SR policies are shared among several UE/sessions.

5.3.3.  SRv6 Drop-in Interworking

   SRv6 drop-in interworking mode provides SRv6 user plane in between
   GTP-U tunnel endpoints.  This mode employs two SRGWs to do GTP-U
   traffic to SRv6 mapping on one SRGW, and vice versa.

Internet-Draft             SRv6-mobile-uplane                  June 2020


   Unlike other interworking modes, both of the mobility overlay
   endpoints use GTP-U.  Two SRGWs are deployed in either N3 or N9
   interface to realize an intermediate SR policy.

   The SRGW behaviors for this mode are equivalent with other modes
   except in IPv6 GTP case on the GTP-U to SRv6 direction.  Due to that
   only one exception, it is enough that this section focuses to
   describe IPv6 GTP case on one direction with an illustration.

5.3.3.1.  Packet flow

   The packet flow of Figure 7 is as follows:

UPF2a/gNB_out: (UPF2a/gNB, U2b::)(GTP: TEID T)(A,Z)
SRGW-A_out   : (SRGW-A, S1)(U2b::, U1b::TEID, C1; SL=3)(A,Z) -> U2b:: is an
                                                                End.M.GTP6.D.Di
                                                                SID at SRGW-A
S1_out       : (SRGW-A, C1)(U2b::, U1b::TEID, C1; SL=2)(A,Z)
C1_out       : (SRGW-A, U1b::TEID)(U2b::, U1b::TEID, C1; SL=1)(A,Z)
SRGW-B_out   : (SRGW-B, U2b::)(GTP: TEID T)(A,Z)             -> U1b::TEID is an
                                                                End.M.GTP6.E
                                                                SID at SRGW-B
UPF2b_out    : (A,Z)

   When a packet destined to Z arrives at the UPF2a, or gNB, which is
   unmodified, performs encapsulates the packet into a new IPv6, UDP and
   GTP headers.  The IPv6 DA, U2b::, and the GTP TEID are the ones
   received at the N2 interface.

   The IPv6 address that was signalled over the N2 interface for that UE
   PDU Session, U2b::, is now the IPv6 DA.  U2b:: is an SRv6 Binding SID
   at SRGW-A.  Hence the packet is routed to the SRGW.

Internet-Draft             SRv6-mobile-uplane                  June 2020


   When the packet arrives at SRGW-A, the SRGW identifies U2b:: as an
   End.M.GTP6.D.Di Binding SID (see Section 6.4).  Hence, the SRGW
   removes the IPv6, UDP and GTP headers, and pushes an IPv6 header with
   its own SRH containing the SIDs bound to the SR policy associated
   with this Binding SID.  There is one instance of the End.M.GTP6.D.Di
   SID per PDU type.

   S1 and C1 perform their related Endpoint functionality and forward
   the packet.

   Once the packet arrives at SRGW-B, the SRGW identifies the active SID
   as an End.M.GTP6.E function.  The SRGW removes the IPv6 header and
   all its extensions headers.  The SRGW generates new IPv6, UDP and GTP
   headers.  The new IPv6 DA is U2b:: which is the last SID in the
   received SRH.  The TEID in the generated GTP header is an argument of
   the received End.M.GTP6.E SID.  The SRGW pushes the headers to the
   packet and forwards the packet toward UPF2b.  There is one instance
   of the End.M.GTP6.E SID per PDU type.

   Once the packet arrives at UPF2b, the packet is a regular IPv6/GTP
   packet.  The UPF looks for the specific rule for that TEID to forward
   the packet.  This UPF behavior is not modified from current and
   previous generations.

5.3.4.  Extensions to the interworking mechanisms

   In this section we presented three mechanisms for interworking with
   gNBs and UPFs that do not support SRv6.  These mechanisms are used to
   support GTP over IPv4 and IPv6.

   Even though we have presented these methods as an extension to the
   "Enhanced mode", it is straightforward in its applicability to the
   "Traditional mode".

   Furthermore, although these mechanisms are designed for interworking
   with legacy RAN at the N3 interface, these methods could also be
   applied for interworking with a non-SRv6 capable UPF at the N9
   interface (e.g.  L3-anchor is SRv6 capable but L2-anchor is not).

6.  SRv6 SID Mobility Functions

6.1.  Args.Mob.Session

   Args.Mob.Session provide per-session information for charging,
   buffering and lawful intercept (among others) required by some mobile
   nodes.  The Args.Mob.Session argument format is used in combination
   with End.Map, End.DT and End.DX functions.  Note that proposed format

   is applicable for 5G networks, while similar formats could be
   proposed for legacy networks.

   o  QFI: QoS Flow Identifier [TS.38415]
   o  R: Reflective QoS Indication [TS.23501].  This parameter indicates
      the activaton of reflective QoS towards the UE for the transfered
      packet.  Reflective QoS enables the UE to map UL User Plane
      traffic to QoS Flows without SMF provided QoS rules.
   o  U: Unused and for future use.  MUST be 0 on transmission and
      ignored on receipt.
   o  PDU Session ID: Identifier of PDU Session.  The GTP-U equivalent
      is TEID.

   Arg.Mob.Session is required in case that one SID aggregates multiple
   PDU Session.  Since the SRv6 function is likely NOT to be
   instantiated per PDU session, Args.Mob.Session helps the UPF to
   perform the functions which require per QFI and/or per PDU Session
   granularity.

6.2.  End.MAP

   The "Endpoint function with SID mapping" function (End.MAP for short)
   is used in several scenarios.  Particularly in mobility, End.MAP is
   used in the UPFs for the PDU Session anchor functionality.

   When a SR node N receives a packet destined to S and S is a local
   End.MAP SID, N does the following:

   1.    Lookup the IPv6 DA in the mapping table
   2.    update the IPv6 DA with the new mapped SID            ;; Ref1
   3.    IF segment_list > 1
   4.       insert a new SRH
   5.    forward according to the new mapped SID

   Ref1: The SIDs in the SRH are NOT modified.

6.3.  End.M.GTP6.D

   The "Endpoint function with IPv6/GTP decapsulation into SR policy"
   function (End.M.GTP6.D for short) is used in interworking scenario
   for the uplink toward from the legacy gNB using IPv6/GTP.  Suppose,
   for example, this SID is associated with an SR policy <S1, S2, S3>
   and an IPv6 Source Address A.

   When the SR Gateway node N receives a packet destined to S and S is a
   local End.M.GTP6.D SID, N does:

    1. IF NH=UDP & UDP_DST_PORT = GTP THEN
    2.    copy TEID to form SID S3
    3.    pop the IPv6, UDP and GTP headers
    4.    push a new IPv6 header with a SR policy in SRH <S1, S2, S3>
    5.    set the outer IPv6 SA to A
    6.    set the outer IPv6 DA to S1
    7.    set the outer IPv6 NH                                  ;; Ref1
    8.    forward according to the S1 segment of the SRv6 Policy
    9. ELSE
   10.    Drop the packet

   Ref1: The NH is set based on the SID parameter.  There is one
   instantiation of the End.M.GTP6.D SID per PDU Session Type, hence the
   NH is already known in advance.  For the IPv4v6 PDU Session Type, in
   addition we inspect the first nibble of the PDU to know the NH value.

   The prefix of last segment(S3 in above example) SHOULD be followed by
   an Arg.Mob.Session argument space which is used to provide the
   session identifiers.

   The prefix of A SHOULD be an End.M.GTP6.E SID instantiated at an SR
   gateway.

6.4.  End.M.GTP6.D.Di

   The "Endpoint function with IPv6/GTP decapsulation into SR policy for
   Drop-in Mode" function (End.M.GTP6.D.Di for short) is used in SRv6
   drop-in interworking scenario described in Section 5.3.3.  The
   difference between End.M.GTP6.D as another variant of IPv6/GTP
   decapsulation function is that the original IPv6 DA of GTP packet is
   preserved as the last SID in SRH.  Suppose, for example, this SID is
   associated with an SR policy <S1, S2, S3> and an IPv6 Source Address
   A.

   When the SR Gateway node N receives a packet destined to S and S is a
   local End.M.GTP6.D.Di SID, N does:

   6.    set the outer IPv6 DA to S1
   7.    set the outer IPv6 NH                                  ;; Ref1

   in addition we inspect the first nibble of the PDU to know the NH
   value.

   The prefix of last segment(S3 in above example) SHOULD be followed by
   an Arg.Mob.Session argument space which is used to provide the
   session identifiers.

   The prefix of A SHOULD be an End.M.GTP6.E SID instantiated at an SR
   gateway.

6.5.  End.M.GTP6.E

   The "Endpoint function with encapsulation for IPv6/GTP tunnel"
   function (End.M.GTP6.E for short) is used in interworking scenario
   for the downlink toward the legacy gNB using IPv6/GTP.

   The prefix of End.M.GTP6.E SID MUST be followed by the
   Arg.Mob.Session argument space which is used to provide the session
   identifiers.

   When the SR Gateway node N receives a packet destined to S, and S is
   a local End.M.GTP6.E SID, N does the following:

    1. IF NH=SRH & SL = 1  THEN                                ;; Ref1

    5.    push new IPv6 header and GTP-U header
    6.    set IPv6 DA to new_DA

    9.    lookup the new_DA and forward the packet accordingly

   Ref1: An End.M.GTP6.E SID MUST always be the penultimate SID.

   Ref2: TEID is extracted from the argument space of the current SID.

   The source address A SHOULD be an End.M.GTP6.D SID instantiated at an
   SR gateway.

6.6.  End.M.GTP4.E

   The "Endpoint function with encapsulation for IPv4/GTP tunnel"
   function (End.M.GTP4.E for short) is used in the downlink when doing
   interworking with legacy gNB using IPv4/GTP.

   When the SR Gateway node N receives a packet destined to S and S is a
   local End.M.GTP4.E SID, N does:

   1. IF (NH=SRH and SL = 0) or ENH=4 THEN
   2.    store IPv6 DA in buffer S
   3.    store IPv6 SA in buffer S'
   4.    pop the IPv6 header and its extension headers
   5.    push UDP/GTP headers with GTP TEID from S
   6.    push outer IPv4 header with SA, DA from S' and S
   7. ELSE
   8.    Drop the packet

   The End.M.GTP4.E SID in S has the following format:

6.7.  T.M.GTP4.D

   The "Transit with tunnel decapsulation and map to an SRv6 policy"
   function (T.M.GTP4.D for short) is used in the direction from legacy
   IPv4 user-plane to SRv6 user-plane network.

   When the SR Gateway node N receives a packet destined to a IW-
   IPv4-Prefix, N does:

   1. IF Payload == UDP/GTP THEN
   2.    pop the outer IPv4 header and UDP/GTP headers
   3.    copy IPv4 DA, TEID to form SID B
   4.    copy IPv4 SA to form IPv6 SA B'
   5.    encapsulate the packet into a new IPv6 header   ;;Ref1
   6.    set the IPv6 DA = B
   7.    forward along the shortest path to B
   8. ELSE
   9.    Drop the packet

   Ref1: The NH value is identified by inspecting the first nibble of
   the inner payload.

   The SID B has the following format:

       0                                                         127

   The SID B MAY be an SRv6 Binding SID instantiated at the first UPF
   (U1) to bind a SR policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   The prefix of B' SHOULD be an End.M.GTP4.E SID with its format
   instantiated at an SR gateway with the IPv4 SA of the receiving
   packet.

6.8.  End.Limit: Rate Limiting function

   The mobile user-plane requires a rate-limit feature.  For this
   purpose, we define a new function "End.Limit".  The "End.Limit"
   function encodes in its arguments the rate limiting parameter that
   should be applied to this packet.  Multiple flows of packets should
   have the same group identifier in the SID when those flows are in an

   same AMBR group.  The encoding format of the rate limit segment SID
   is as follows:

              | LOC+FUNC rate-limit  | group-id | limit-rate|

             End.Limit: Rate limiting function argument format

   If the limit-rate bits are set to zero, the node should not do rate
   limiting unless static configuration or control-plane sets the limit
   rate associated to the SID.

7.  SRv6 supported 3GPP PDU session types

   The 3GPP [TS.23501] defines the following PDU session types:

   o  IPv4
   o  IPv6
   o  IPv4v6
   o  Ethernet
   o  Unstructured

   SRv6 supports the 3GPP PDU session types without any protocol
   overhead by using the corresponding SRv6 functions (End.DX4, End.DT4
   for IPv4 PDU sessions; End.DX6, End.DT6, End.T for IPv6 PDU sessions;
   End.DT46 for IPv4v6 PDU sessions; End.DX2 for L2 PDU sessions).
   Unstructured PDUs are not supported.

8.  Network Slicing Considerations

   A mobile network may be required to implement "network slices", which
   logically separate network resources.  User-plane functions
   represented as SRv6 segments would be part of a slice.

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] describes a solution to
   build basic network slices with SR.  Depending on the requirements,
   these slices can be further refined by adopting the mechanisms from:

   o  IGP Flex-Algo [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo]
   o  Inter-Domain policies
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe]

   Furthermore, these can be combined with ODN/AS
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] for automated slice
   provisioning and traffic steering.

   Further details on how these tools can be used to create end to end
   network slices are documented in
   [I-D.ali-spring-network-slicing-building-blocks].

9.  Control Plane Considerations

   This document focuses on user-plane behavior and its independence
   from the control plane.

   The control plane could be the current 3GPP-defined control plane
   with slight modifications to the N4 interface [TS.29244].

   Alternatively, SRv6 could be used in conjunction with a new mobility
   control plane as described in LISP [I-D.rodrigueznatal-lisp-srv6],
   hICN [I-D.auge-dmm-hicn-mobility-deployment-options], MFA
   [I-D.gundavelli-dmm-mfa] or in conjunction with FPC
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp].  The analysis of new mobility control-planes
   and its applicability to SRv6 is out of the scope of this document.

   Section 11 allocates SRv6 endpoint function types for the new
   functions defined in this document.  Control-plane protocols are
   expected to use these function type codes to signal each function.

   SRv6's network programming nature allows a flexible and dynamic UPF
   placement.

10.  Security Considerations

   TBD

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate, within the "SRv6 Endpoint Types" sub-
   registry belonging to the top-level "Segment-routing with IPv6
   dataplane (SRv6) Parameters" registry
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], the following values:

Appendix A.  Implementations

   This document introduces new SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors.  These
   behaviors have an open-source P4 implementation available in
   <https://github.com/ebiken/p4srv6>.

   Additionally, a full implementation of this document is available in
   Linux Foundation FD.io VPP project since release 20.05.  More
   information available here: <https://docs.fd.io/vpp/20.05/d7/d3c/
   srv6_mobile_plugin_doc.html>.

   There are also experimental implementations in M-CORD NGIC and Open
   Air Interface (OAI).
